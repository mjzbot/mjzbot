# SML: Standard ML

this is more of a test page:



```sml
auto a = 10
```

{% hint style="info" %}
to give you a good hint on this


{% endhint %}

> <mark style="color:orange;">**I always likes quotes**</mark>

{% file src=".gitbook/assets/Chapter_1_Introducing_System_Design__News_Feed_System_v6.0.4 (1).pdf" %}
some PDF notes
{% endfile %}

![](<.gitbook/assets/super bowl 2022.jpeg>)
